## *Objective*  
The project aims to:  
- Analyze sales trends across customer segments, regions, and product categories.  
- Identify high-performing products, cities, and states.  
- Evaluate the impact of shipping modes and customer segments on total sales.  
- Create visualizations to highlight key findings.

## *Dataset*  
The dataset used for this project is the *Superstore Sales Dataset*, which contains:  
- *9,994 rows*  
- *21 columns*  

The key columns include:  
- Order Date, Ship Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount  
- Segment, Category, Sub-Category, State, City, Region

## *Project Structure*  
The project is organized as follows:  

1. *Data Loading and Overview*  
   - Importing required libraries.  
   - Understanding the dataset (shape, columns, data types).  

2. *Data Cleaning*  
   - Checking for null values and duplicates.  
   - Converting dates to appropriate format.  

3. *Outlier Detection*  
   - Visualizing outliers in sales for product categories.  

4. *Customer Analysis*  
   - Exploring customer segments and their contribution to sales.  
   - Visualizing customer distribution.  

5. *Shipping Mode Analysis*  
   - Analyzing and visualizing the preferred shipping methods.  

6. *Geographical Analysis*  
   - Sales trends by states and cities.  
   - Identifying top-performing regions.  

7. *Product Analysis*  
   - Sales distribution across categories and sub-categories.  
   - Identifying top products based on sales.  

8. *Final Insights*  
   - Summary of key observations and business recommendations.  
---

## *Key Insights*  
- *Customer Segments*: Consumers contribute the largest share of sales (52%).  
- *Shipping Modes*: Standard Class is the most popular shipping method (~60%).  
- *Geographical Performance*:  
   - *Top State*: California  
   - *Top City*: New York City  
- *Product Analysis*:  
   - *Top Category*: Technology  
   - *Top Products*: Phones and Chairs generate maximum revenue.
